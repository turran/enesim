Enesim
======
+ Rename every enum to be part of its own system
+ Rename the enesim_image_data to enesim_io or enesim_stream_ as it makes more sense to split
  it from the image subsytem to be used on other places
+ Add the luminance format
+ We have a performance problem when some renderer has changed. Basically on the practice
  we end having a full tree of renderers, several levels, proxies, whatever. When we need
  to know what area to draw we basically iterate over all the tree. That means that we start
  from the topmost renderer and then going down, even if no children has actually changed
  we still need to call a function on each child to see if it has changed or not. In case
  of damages it is the same.

  So we need a way to inform somehow whenever a renderer has changed "upstream" to avoid
  iterating over all the children Here upstream refers that if a renderer is for example
  added on a compound renderer, when the children have a _set() function it should call a
  function in the form of:
  enesim_renderer_notify_change().
  This function should call a list of "listeners" of such
  "event" so for example the compund renderer can listen to that and again inform "upstream"
  of a change.
+ Add log levels on every subsystem/renderer
+ Make use of the flags on the surface draw function
+ We need to get rid of the hypot function, it is used on a lot places
  but with f16p16 values
+ We need to use the real types on the rendering functions
+ We need to simplify the real rendering functions into its own
  c file with its own struct, this way in the future we can reuse the
  algorithm for other backends
+ Split the hswitch and transition common parts into a common transition renderer
  with properties as src, target and step, that's all
+ Initialize every renderer to some sane vales
+ We need to use whenever possible functions for fixed point operations. This way later we can just
  create some #defines for them and we can easily change from 16.16 to 32.32 or stuff like that
+ The renderers should implement or even the change interface or the damage, there's no need to iterate
  the rendernig tree twice, one for the change callback and another for the damage callback
+ If we do the above then we should remove the enesim_renderer_has_changed API function, it should just
  request the damages. If no damages, then no change, etc. Or implement the changed as a call to damages
  with a simple callback that whenever a some damage area is returned then we should just abort and return
  true

Image
=====
+ Remove the mime parameter, we can autodetect it when loading

Text
====
+ Add a path-follow-span, i.e a text span that can receive
  a shape and use that as the path to follow. We need more
  code on enesim to know whenever a renderer is of a specific
  type, similar to what we are doing on eon
+ Add rich text element
